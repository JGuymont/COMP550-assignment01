    ngram_range : tuple (min_n, max_n)
        The lower and upper boundary of the range of n-values for different
        n-grams to be extracted. All values of n such that min_n <= n <= max_n
        will be used.

    stop_words : string {'english'}, list, or None (default)
        If 'english', a built-in stop word list for English is used.

        If a list, that list is assumed to contain stop words, all of which
        will be removed from the resulting tokens.
        Only applies if ``analyzer == 'word'``.

        If None, no stop words will be used. max_df can be set to a value
        in the range [0.7, 1.0) to automatically detect and filter stop
        words based on intra corpus document frequency of terms.

    max_df : float in range [0.0, 1.0] or int, default=1.0
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly higher than the given threshold (corpus-specific
        stop words).
        If float, the parameter represents a proportion of documents, integer
        absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.

    min_df : float in range [0.0, 1.0] or int, default=1
        When building the vocabulary ignore terms that have a document
        frequency strictly lower than the given threshold. This value is also
        called cut-off in the literature.
        If float, the parameter represents a proportion of documents, integer
        absolute counts.
        This parameter is ignored if vocabulary is not None.
